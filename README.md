# N-puzzle
A program to solve the N-puzzle using A* and Manhattan Distance

Welcome to my first GitHub repository!

This program has been quite a challenge for me since last wednesday (5th Aug, 2020).
So i have managed to finally solve this. (the program actually runs and solves the problem now).

Feel free to use this code wherever you want (Computer science students will find it most useful).

code.txt has the entire source code (WRITTEN IN JAVA).
