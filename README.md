# N-puzzle
A program to solve the N-puzzle using A* and Manhattan Distance

Welcome to my first GitHub repository!

This program has been quite a challenge for me since last wednesday (5th Aug, 2020).
So i have managed to finally solve this. (the program actually runs and solves the problem now).

Feel free to use this code wherever you want (Computer science students will find it most useful).

code.txt has the entire source code (WRITTEN IN JAVA).

STEPS to run code.txt
!!you must have a java ide to run it. (or a platform on which java code can run).!!
1) THERE IS NO PUBLIC STATIC VOID MAIN. SO AN IDE IS REQUIRED TO RUN THE RAW CODE. (PREFERRABLY BlueJ.)
2) If you're using BlueJ, then right click on the class-box "Puzzle" and select new Puzzle().
3) name the instance and hit enter.
4) enter the size (eg- 2, 3, 4, 5)
5) right-click on the instance and click on "void solveAstar()" if you want to solve it using A* algo (faster) or "void solveBFS()" if you want to solve using Breadth-First-Search    (slower).
6) try out various boards.
